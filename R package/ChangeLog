0.2-3571 (Oct 10, 2020)
  * Added routines for ordinary least-squares (OLS) using several methods: Cholesky
	  (chol), QR decomposition (qr), singular value decomposition (svd), and the
		Sweep operator (sweep). This provides an alternative to extend the procedures
		available in OLS.
	* Routine for estimation of the covariance matrix using the Mean Square Successive
	  Method (MSSD) was included.
	* Added routine to estimation of the weighted mean and covariance matrix.
	* Wrapper to a C version of the Kronecker product.
	* Several new addtions to the Interface to C code callable by another packages.
	* Underlying code to estimation of the covariance matrix were slightly recrafted
	  to avoid data movement.

0.2-357 (Sep 17, 2020)
	* Added routines to support SpatialPack R package.
	* Set of routines for LU factorization was added.
	* Matrix inversion inside 'sherman.morrison' now use 'lu2inv' function.
	* Added functions to do operations envolving the symmetrizer matrix.

0.2-35 (Sep 05, 2020)
	* src/minkowski.f: An error was fixed in Fortran function underlying to Lp-norm
	  (minkowski) for vectors with increments not equal to one.
	* Clean-ups in C, R code and documentation.
	* Minor issue in R_init_fastmatrix.c file was corrected.
	* Interface to C code callable by another C code from other packages is provided.

0.2-3 (Aug 28, 2020)
	* Added functions for array multiplication and bracket product.
	* Added functions to do operations envolving the commutation matrix.
	* Functions for inner products and norms for matrices were included.
	* Added 'minkowski' function to Lp-norm computation on vectors.
	* Added function to do column-equilibration on rectangular matrices with the
	  aim of reduce its condition number.
	* A routine for computation of the dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector
	  using the power method was included.
	* Added a function to carry out the sweep operator on symmetric matrices.
	* An implementation of Sherman-Morrison formula was added.

0.2 (Aug 14, 2020)
	* Initial release of the fastmatrix package on CRAN
