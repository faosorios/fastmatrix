0.3-81 (Feb 05, 2021)
 * ols function now has a method for conjugate gradients (cg) to fits a linear regression.
 * Now cov.weighted is slightly faster.

0.3-8 (Jan 21, 2021)
 * Added function to fit a linear model by ridge regression. This routine has options
   to choose the ridge parameter by minimizing the generalized cross-validation criterion
   as well as selecting an optimal value from a grid of specified values.
 * Added function to compute the geometric mean using a Fused-Multiply-and-Add (FMA)
   compensated scheme for accurate computation of floating-point product.
 * Added function to compute the Wilson-Hilferty transformation for chi-squared random
   variables.

0.3 (Nov 24, 2020)
 * Added routines is.lower.tri and is.upper.tri for checking if a matrix is lower
   or upper triangular.
 * Routine for computation of the Mahalanobis distances was added, this function
   checks if the covariance is a positive definite matrix.
 * Added routines to compute measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis proposed
   by Mardia (Biometrika 57, 519-530).
 * Several C symbols callable by another packages were added.

0.2-3571 (Oct 10, 2020)
 * Added routines to support L1pack R package.
 * Added routines for ordinary least-squares (OLS) using several methods: Cholesky
   (chol), QR decomposition (qr), singular value decomposition (svd), and the
   Sweep operator (sweep). This provides an alternative to extend the procedures
   available in OLS.
 * Routine for estimation of the covariance matrix using the Mean Square Successive
   Method (MSSD) was included.
 * Added routine to estimation of the weighted mean and covariance matrix.
 * Wrapper to a C version of the Kronecker product.
 * Several new addtions to the Interface to C code callable by another packages.
 * Underlying code to estimation of the covariance matrix were slightly recrafted
   to avoid data movement.

0.2-357 (Sep 17, 2020)
 * Added routines to support SpatialPack R package.
 * Set of routines for LU factorization was added.
 * Matrix inversion inside 'sherman.morrison' now use 'lu2inv' function.
 * Added functions to do operations envolving the symmetrizer matrix.

0.2-35 (Sep 05, 2020)
 * src/minkowski.f: An error was fixed in Fortran function underlying to Lp-norm
   (minkowski) for vectors with increments not equal to one.
 * Clean-ups in C, R code and documentation.
 * Minor issue in R_init_fastmatrix.c file was corrected.
 * Interface to C code callable by another C code from other packages is provided.

0.2-3 (Aug 28, 2020)
 * Added functions for array multiplication and bracket product.
 * Added functions to do operations envolving the commutation matrix.
 * Functions for inner products and norms for matrices were included.
 * Added 'minkowski' function to Lp-norm computation on vectors.
 * Added function to do column-equilibration on rectangular matrices with the
   aim of reduce its condition number.
 * A routine for computation of the dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector
   using the power method was included.
 * Added a function to carry out the sweep operator on symmetric matrices.
 * An implementation of Sherman-Morrison formula was added.

0.2 (Aug 14, 2020)
 * Initial release of the fastmatrix package on CRAN
