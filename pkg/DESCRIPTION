Description: Small set of functions designed to speed up the computation of certain 
  matrix operations that are commonly used in statistics and econometrics. It provides 
  efficient implementations for the computation of several structured matrices, matrix 
  decompositions and statistical procedures, many of which have minimal memory overhead.
  Furthermore, the package provides interfaces to C code callable by another C code 
  from other R packages.
