# Fast computation of some matrices useful in statistics

Yet another R package for matrices. It contains a small set of functions to fast computation of some matrices and operations useful in statistics.

## Features

Currently we have implemented the following functions:
* Operations envolving the duplication matrix, with minimum requeriments of storage.
* Fast computation of Hadamard product using unrolled loops.
* vec and vech operators to handle rectangular and square matrices.

Our plan in the near future is the implementation of functions to handle:
* Commutation, elimination and symmetrizer matrices.
* Intern products and norms for matrices.
* Array multiplication (see for instance, Appendix A of Wei, 1998).
* Some special matrices arising in numerical analysis.

## Providing Feedback
