Yet another R package for matrices. It contains a small set of functions to fast computation of some matrices and operations useful in statistics. **Suggested Extension** by [fastverse](https://fastverse.github.io/fastverse/).

## Features

Latest release (Sep 06, 2024) of [fastmatrix](https://github.com/faosorios/fastmatrix) package have implemented the following functions:
* Array multiplication (see for instance, Appendix A of Wei, 1998).
* Bezier curve based on n+1 control points.
* C version of the Kronecker product which is slightly faster than the built in R base.
* Column-equilibration for rectangular and symmetric matrices.
* Computation of a matrix square root using the Newton iteration proposed by Denman and Beavers (1976).
* Constructors for AR(1) and compound symmetry correlation matrices.
* Constructors for Frank, Hankel and Helmert matrices.
* Covariance matrix estimation using the Mean Square Successive (MSSD) method.
* Estimation of the weighted mean and covariance matrix using an online algorithm (Clarke, 1971).
* Computation of central moments up to fourth order using an online algorithm (Spicer, 1972).
* Evaluation of a real general matrix polynomial using Horner's scheme.
* Fast computation of Hadamard product using unrolled loops.
* Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi and conjugate gradients (CG) iterative methods for solving linear systems.
* Geometric mean using a Fused-Multiply-and-Add (FMA) compensated scheme for accurate computation of floating-point product.
* Inner products and norms for matrices.
* Computation of the scaled condition number of a rectangular matrix.
* Interface to **C code callable by another C code** from other R packages.
* LDL decomposition for symmetric real matrices.
* Computation of the modified Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric but not necessarily positive definite matrix.
* Lp norms for vectors.
* LU factorization for square matrices.
* Mahalanobis distances, checking if the covariance is a positive definite matrix.
* Modified Cholesky factorization for symmetric but not necessarily positive definite matrices.
* Omnibus test for univariate normality (Jarque-Bera, Doornik-Hansen, Adjusted Lagrange multiplier test and robust version by Gel and Gastwirt, 2008).
* Operations envolving the **commutation matrix**, with minimum requirements of storage.
* Operations envolving the **duplication matrix**, with minimum requirements of storage.
* Operations envolving the **symmetrizer matrix**, with minimum requirements of storage.
* Ordinary least-squares (OLS) using several methods: conjugate gradients, Cholesky, QR decomposition, singular value decomposition, and the Sweep operator. This provides an alternative to extend the procedures available in R built-in function 'lm'.
* Power method to compute the dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector.
* Random number generation from the multivariate normal (Gaussian) distribution.
* Random number generation of uniformly distributed deviates **within** a unitary ball.
* Random number generation of uniformly distributed deviats located **on** a spherical surface.
* Rank 1 update to Cholesky factorization.
* Ridge estimation for linear regression.
* Routines to compute measures of multivariate skewness and kurtosis proposed by Mardia (1970).
* Routine for the computation of the mediancenter (or geometric median) of multivariate data.
* Routine to compute a Krylov matrix.
* Sherman-Morrison formula.
* Sweep operator for symmetric matrices.
* Test for variance homogeneity of correlated variables (Harris, 1985).
* vec and vech operators to handle rectangular and square matrices.
* Whitening transformation.
* Wilson-Hilferty transformation for Gamma random variables.

Our plan in the near future is the implementation of functions to handle:
* Some special matrices and operations arising in numerical analysis.

## Installation instructions

To install [fastmatrix](https://github.com/faosorios/fastmatrix) **(version 0.5-9017)** from CRAN, start R and enter:
```r
install.packages("fastmatrix")
```

Or install it from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/faosorios/fastmatrix). First install the [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) package.
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then install [fastmatrix](https://github.com/faosorios/fastmatrix) using the `install_github` function in [devtools](https://devtools.r-lib.org/)
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("faosorios/fastmatrix", subdir = "pkg")
```

Alternatively, you can download the source as a tarball (.tar.gz file). Unpack this file (thereby creating a directory named, [fastmatrix](https://github.com/faosorios/fastmatrix)) and install the package source by executing (at the console prompt)
```
R CMD INSTALL fastmatrix
```

Next, you can load the package by using the command: `library(fastmatrix)`
