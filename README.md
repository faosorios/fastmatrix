Yet another R package for matrices. It contains a small set of functions designed to speed up the computation of certain matrix operations that are commonly used in statistics and econometrics. It provides efficient implementations for the computation of several structured matrices, matrix decompositions and statistical procedures, many of which have minimal memory overhead. **Suggested Extension** by [fastverse](https://fastverse.github.io/fastverse/).

Currently, the fastmatrix package provides support for the following R packages:

## Features

Next, the main functionalities of [fastmatrix](https://github.com/faosorios/fastmatrix) (latest release, version 0.6-2, Oct 14, 2025):
* Structured matrices:
  * Constructors for AR(1) and compound symmetry correlation matrices.
  * Constructors for Frank, Hankel and Helmert matrices.
  * Operations envolving the **commutation matrix**, with minimum requirements of storage.
  * Operations envolving the **duplication matrix**, with minimum requirements of storage.
  * Operations envolving the **symmetrizer matrix**, with minimum requirements of storage.
* Matrix operations and decompositions:
  * Array multiplication (see for instance, Appendix A of [Wei, 1998](https://link.springer.com/book/9789813083295)).
  * C version of the Kronecker product which is slightly faster than the built in R base.
  * Column-equilibration for rectangular and symmetric matrices.
  * Evaluation of a real general matrix polynomial using Horner's scheme.
  * Evaluation of a matrix function where its argument is an upper triangular matrix by applying a Parlett recurrence.
  * Fast computation of Hadamard (elementwise) product using unrolled loops.
  * Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi and conjugate gradients (CG) iterative methods for solving linear systems.
  * Inner products and norms for matrices.
  * Computation of the scaled condition number of a rectangular matrix.
  * LDL decomposition for symmetric real matrices.
  * Computation of the modified Cholesky factorization of a real symmetric but not necessarily positive definite matrix.
  * Lp norms for vectors.
  * LU factorization for square matrices.
  * Matrix square root using the Newton iteration proposed by [Denman and Beavers (1976)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0096-3003(76)90020-5) and the Schur decomposition.
  * Modified Cholesky factorization for symmetric but not necessarily positive definite matrices.
  * Power method to compute the dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector.
  * Rank-1 update to Cholesky factorization.
  * Routine to compute a Krylov matrix.
  * Schur decomposition for a square matrix.
  * Sherman-Morrison formula.
  * Sweep operator for symmetric matrices.
  * vec and vech operators to handle rectangular and square matrices.
* Statistical procedures:
  * Covariance matrix estimation using the Mean Square Successive (MSSD) method.
  * Estimation of the weighted mean and covariance matrix using an online algorithm ([Clarke, 1971](https://doi.org/10.2307/2346477)).
  * Computation of central moments up to fourth order using an online algorithm ([Spicer, 1972](https://doi.org/10.2307/2346477)).
  * Geometric mean using a Fused-Multiply-and-Add (FMA) compensated scheme for accurate computation of floating-point product.
  * Mahalanobis distances, checking if the covariance is a positive definite matrix.
  * Mardia's test for multivariate normality ([Mardia, 1974](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25051892)).
  * Omnibus test for univariate normality ([Jarque-Bera](https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-1765(80)90024-5), [Doornik-Hansen](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0084.2008.00537.x), Adjusted Lagrange multiplier test ([Urzua, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0165-1765(96)00923-8)) and a robust version proposed by [Gel and Gastwirt, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2007.05.022)).

Our plan in the near future is the implementation of functions to handle:
* Some special matrices and operations arising in numerical analysis.
